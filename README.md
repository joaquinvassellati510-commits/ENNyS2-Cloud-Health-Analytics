🥗 ENNyS2 Cloud Health Analytics

End-to-End Data Project | Public Health & Nutrition | BigQuery + Looker Studio

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes Argentina’s National Survey on Nutrition and Health (ENNyS2) to build a cloud-based analytics pipeline that transforms raw public health microdata into actionable nutrition and epidemiological indicators for policy makers, health professionals, and NGOs.

The project simulates a real-world data analyst role in the public health and health-tech sector, focusing on data quality, transformation, modeling, and visualization in a cloud environment.

🎯 Problem Statement

Public health datasets in Argentina are often underutilized due to:

High complexity and fragmentation of raw microdata

Lack of standardized analytical models for nutrition indicators

Limited access to cloud-based dashboards for decision-makers

This project addresses these gaps by building a scalable, cloud-native analytics pipeline that converts raw ENNyS2 data into structured, documented, and visual health intelligence.

🧠 Key Questions

What is the prevalence of undernutrition, overweight, and obesity by region and age group?

How do socioeconomic variables correlate with dietary patterns?

Which provinces show the highest nutritional risk indicators?

How can cloud analytics improve access to public health insights?
